# Loan Default Risk Model
This is a Machine Learning based program which predicts the risk of a user defaulting, using Logistic Regression.

Overview

The model is trained on various financial and social factors such as - 
- Income
- Age
- Credit score
- Late payments etc...
  
I chose to use logistic regression as it is very well suited for any binary classification problems, where the outcome was either 0 - no default, or 1 - default.
They key components of my program involved the Sigmoid function, the Logistic Loss function, and Gradient Descent.

After training and testing my program, the model predicted defaults with an accuracy of over 90%, and so was quite successful.
